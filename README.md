## This is a photography portfolio for myself

Photography is one of my hobbies, and I dabble in all sorts of genres, from architecture to wildlife.

As of right now, there is not a published version.

### This is also a project to help me relearn react and css fundementals

This was a challenge to myself to learn more advanced css and build something beyond my previous capabilities.
My goals included parallax, moving elements, and much more.
